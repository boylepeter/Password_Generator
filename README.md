# Password_Generator

##Goal:
To create a randomized password generator, capable of returning a password including lower and upper case letters, numbers and special characters on demand. 
User will be prompted as to the input of the password which will then be executed via javascript to create the password. 
This will be accomplished while ensuring clean, legible, and ordered code.

##The following conditions must be met per client instruction:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
