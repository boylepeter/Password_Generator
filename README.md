# Password_Generator

Goal:
To create a randomized password generator, capable of returning a password including lower, upper case letters, numbers and special characters on demand. 
User will be prompted as to the input of the password which will then be executed via javascript to create the password. 
This will be accomplished while ensuring clean, legible, and ordered code.
